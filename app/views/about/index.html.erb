      We sell stuff that nobody wants to buy at outrageous prices. Our products are all 100% toxic, non-biodegradeable, sourced from unethical and very unsustainable business practices, and if you buy now, will come with free asbestos packaging and a chance to win 50mg of raw Uranium-235. (Perfect gift for children or scientists who want to build an illegal backyard nuclear reactor*)
